### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer working at an AI startup,<br>
where I build systems that actually help people — not just through code, but by solving real problems.

- Working at [common computer](https://comcom.ai/)
- Backend-heavy, but full-stack curious
- Work with `.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, `.java` (and ❤️ `.ts`)
- Currently learning Agent framework (like LangChain)
- Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajy9844) or [email](mailto:ajy09844@gmail.com)
